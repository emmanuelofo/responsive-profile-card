Blog Card Project
Welcome to the Blog Card Project! This is a simple yet elegant front-end project that showcases a blog card component, perfect for displaying a snippet of content like a blog post preview. As someone who's learning front-end development and loves music and anime art, I crafted this project to blend clean design with a touch of creativity. Whether you're here to learn, tweak, or just vibe with the code, I hope you find this project inspiring!

Project Overview
This project features a single blog card with a modern, minimalist design. It uses HTML for structure and CSS for styling, creating a visually appealing card with a subtle anime-inspired aesthetic (think clean lines and vibrant accents). The card displays a blog post preview with an image, category tag, publish date, title, description, and author details.
Features

Responsive Design: The card adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
Custom Styling: Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, ensuring easy theme changes.
Hover Effects: The blog title changes color on hover, adding interactivity.
Shadow Effect: A creative offset shadow gives the card a playful, 3D look.
Accessible Fonts: Uses the 'Figtree' font from Google Fonts for a modern, readable style.

Getting Started
To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) for tweaking the code.
Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Installation

Clone or Download:

Clone this repository: git clone <repository-url> or download the ZIP file.
Alternatively, copy the index.html and style.css files into a new project folder.


Add Google Fonts:

The project uses the 'Figtree' font. Ensure the index.html file includes the Google Fonts link in the <head> section:<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:wght@400;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">




Add an Image:

The index.html file references an image (<img src="...">) in the .card section. Place your desired image (e.g., blog-image.jpg) in the same folder as index.html and update the <img> tag:<img src="blog-image.jpg" alt="Blog post illustration">




Open the Project:

Open index.html in a web browser by double-clicking the file or using a local server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension).



File Structure
blog-card-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # The main HTML file containing the blog card structure
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css        # The CSS file with styling for the blog card
â””â”€â”€ blog-image.jpg   # (Optional) Placeholder for the blog post image

Usage

View the Card: Open index.html in a browser to see the blog card in action. It displays a sample blog post about HTML & CSS foundations.
Edit Content: Modify the text in index.html (e.g., title, description, author name) to customize the blog post details.
Change Styling: Tweak style.css to adjust colors, fonts, or layout to match your vibeâ€”maybe add some anime-inspired colors or gradients!

Customization
Want to make it your own? Here are some ideas:

Colors: Update the CSS custom properties in :root (e.g., --yellow, --black) to match your favorite palette. For an anime-inspired look, try vibrant colors like neon pink or electric blue!
Fonts: Swap 'Figtree' for another Google Font (e.g., 'Poppins' or 'Roboto') by updating the Google Fonts link and font-family in style.css.
Image: Replace the blog image with something that resonates with you, like an anime-style illustration or a music-themed graphic.
Hover Effects: Experiment with different hover effects in .card h1 a:hover (e.g., add a transition for smooth animations).

Example: To change the card's background to a soft blue, update style.css:
:root {
    --yellow: hsl(200, 80%, 70%); /* Soft blue */
}

Responsive Design
The card is optimized for all devices:

On screens smaller than 500px, the card scales to 85% of the viewport width, and the title font size reduces for better readability.
The layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure content stays centered and aligned.

Test it on different devices or use your browser's developer tools to simulate mobile views.
